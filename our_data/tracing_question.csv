"Find the odd int
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples

[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).","public static int find_it(int[] seq)

                        .Select(x => x.Key).FirstOrDefault();
    
        return oddInt;
  }{

"Sum of Digits / Digital Root
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples

    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2","using System; public class Number { static int res;

        length--;
        str = res.ToString();
        
        
    } while (length != 1);
