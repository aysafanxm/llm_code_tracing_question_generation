"Sum of Digits / Digital Root
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples

    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2","using System; public class Number { static int res;

public int DigitalRoot(long n) { var str = n.ToString(); int length = str.Length; do { res = 0; for (int i = 0; i < str.Length; i++) { int conv = (int)Char.GetNumericValue(str[i]); res += conv; }

        length--;
        str = res.ToString();
        
        
    } while (length != 1);

    return res;
} }","How does the code handle the case when the input is a single digit number, like 9?","That's a problem with your code, not a kata issue. You have an infinite loop if the initial number is a single digit number. Please read this: https://docs.codewars.com/training/troubleshooting#post-discourse",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
